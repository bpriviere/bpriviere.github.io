**About Me** 
<br /> 
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology](https://galcit.caltech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Soon-Jo Chung](http://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/).
I collaborate closely with [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) and [Dr. Wolfgang Hoenig](https://whoenig.github.io/).  
I work on the intersection of machine learning and planning, with applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. I received the B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2017, and the M.S. in Aeronautics from Caltech in 2018.
